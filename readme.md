## Overview

**Project Title**: Practice Typing

**Project Description**: A typing simulator to gamify typing practice. My part was adding the database and creating the server.

**Project Goals**: The goal of the project is to gamify typing in a fun way. My goal was to create a user authentication with Firebase.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. You will need node installed.
2. Using node, install firebase, express, and firebase-admin. If you want you can also use nodemon.
3. You start the server by typing npm start in your terminal.

Instructions for using the software:

1. The software is connected specifically to my firebase account. You will be able to play the game and login right now.
2. When you start the software you can just play the game.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You will need node installed on your computer.
* Install using node, firebase-admin, firebase, and express.
* You will need to use the firebase console to create your own project and change the data in the firebase-config to have data be sent to your own project.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
* [Tutorial of Firebase using Node.js](https://youtu.be/8Se_F7c03UM?si=et4oNsGNuMH5amqo)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] My one goal after this is to be able to connect data that the game has and send it to the firebase storage and be able to call the data again when a user log-ons and off.
